seq $0,347266 ; a(n) is the number whose binary representation is the concatenation of terms in the n-th row of A237048.
seq $0,345927 ; Alternating sum of the binary expansion of n (row n of A030190). Replace 2^k with (-1)^(A070939(n)-k) in the binary expansion of n (compare to the definition of A065359).
seq $0,38 ; Twice A000007.
div $0,2
