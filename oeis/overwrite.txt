A000005: d(n) (also called tau(n) or sigma_0(n)), the number of divisors of n.
A000040: The prime numbers.
A000203: a(n) = sigma(n), the sum of the divisors of n. Also called sigma_1(n).
A010051: Characteristic function of primes: 1 if n is prime, else 0.
A020639: Lpf(n): least prime dividing n (when n > 1); a(1) = 1. Or, smallest prime factor of n, or smallest prime divisor of n.
A063918: a(1) = 1 and - applying the sieve of Eratosthenes - for n > 1: a(n) = if n is prime then 0 else the first prime p which marks n as composite.
A080339: Characteristic function of {1} union {primes}: 1 if n is 1 or a prime, else 0.
A293810: The truncated kernel function of n: the product of distinct primes dividing n, but excluding the largest prime divisor of n.
