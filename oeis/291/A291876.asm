; A291876: Consider the graph with one central vertex connected to three outer vertices (a star graph). Then, a(n) is the minimum number of moves required to transfer a stack of n pegs from one outer vertex to another outer vertex, moving pegs to adjacent vertices, following the rules of the Towers of Hanoi.
