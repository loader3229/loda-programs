seq $0,281216 ; Decimal representation of the x-axis, from the left edge to the origin, of the n-th stage of growth of the two-dimensional cellular automaton defined by "Rule 342", based on the 5-celled von Neumann neighborhood.
seq $0,30101 ; a(n) is the number produced when n is converted to binary digits, the binary digits are reversed and then converted back into a decimal number.
