; A061987: Number of times n-th distinct value is repeated in sequence b(k) = 1 + b(floor(k/2)) + b(floor(k/3)) with b(0) = 0, i.e., in A061984; also number of times n-th distinct row is repeated in square array T(n,k) = T(n-1,k) + T(n-1,floor(k/2)) + T(n-1,floor(k/3)) with T(0,0) = 1, i.e., in A061980.
