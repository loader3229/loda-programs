  seq $0,187067 ; Let i be in {1,2,3} and let r >= 0 be an integer. Let p = {p_1, p_2, p_3} = {-2,0,1}, n = 2*r + p_i and define a(-2)=0. Then, a(n) = a(2*r + p_i) gives the quantity of H_(7,3,0) tiles in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile after linear scaling by the factor x^r, where x = sqrt(2*cos(Pi/7)).
