; A143997: Rectangular array by antidiagonals: label each unit square in the first quadrant lattice by its northeast vertex (x,y) and mark squares for which (x,y) is congruent mod 4 to one of the following: (1,4), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1); then R(m,n) is the number of UNmarked squares in the rectangle [0,m]x[0,n].
