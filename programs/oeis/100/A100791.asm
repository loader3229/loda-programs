; A100791: Group the natural numbers so that the n-th group contains n(n+1)/2 = T(n) terms: (1), (2,3,4), (5,6,7,8,9,10), (11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20),(21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35),... The n-th row of the following triangle is formed from the sum of first n terms, next n-1 terms,next n-2 terms ... of the n-th group; e.g. third row is (5+6+7), (8+9), (10) or 18,17,10. Sequence contains the triangle read by rows.
