# LODA Programs

LODA is an assembly language, a computational model and a tool for mining integer sequences. You can use it to search programs that calculate integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](http://oeis.org/) (OEIS®).

This repository contains programs that generate integer sequences from the OEIS. The vast majority of these programs has been automatically generated using [loda-cpp](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp), but there are also a few hand-written programs.

There are currently :star: &nbsp; **More than 35k programs available!** :star: &nbsp; You can find lists with descriptions and links here:

* [A000001 - A050000](oeis/list0.md)
* [A050001 - A100000](oeis/list1.md)
* [A100001 - A150000](oeis/list2.md)
* [A150001 - A200000](oeis/list3.md) 
* [A200001 - A250000](oeis/list4.md)
* [A250001 - A300000](oeis/list5.md)
* [A300001 - A350000](oeis/list6.md)
* [A350001 - A400000](oeis/list7.md)
